## 🛠 Enterprise Tech Stack

This project represents a **state-of-the-art** integration of modern AI and real-time communication technologies.

### **The "Brain" (AI & Voice)**
*   **LLM (Orchestrator)**: `OpenAI GPT-4o-mini` - Optimized for high-speed reasoning and function calling.
*   **TTS (Voice Synthesis)**: `Cartesia` - The gold standard in ultra-low latency, expressive AI voices.
*   **STT (Transcription)**: `Gladia.io` - Enterprise-grade speech-to-text with specialized medical term recognition.
*   **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)**: `Silero VAD` - High-precision silence and speech detection.

### **The "Nervous System" (Networking)**
*   **Real-time Protocol**: `LiveKit Agents SDK v1.5+` - Handling audio streams and WebRTC connections with zero jitter.
*   **Deployment**: `Fly.io` - Globally distributed Docker containers for minimal latency.

### **The "Memory" (Backend)**
*   **Database**: `Supabase` (PostgreSQL) - Persistent storage for call logs, patient data, and dashboard settings.
*   **Knowledge Base**: Custom **RAG Pipeline** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) utilizing vector embeddings for clinic-specific knowledge.
*   **Scheduling**: `Cal.com API` - Real-time calendar synchronization for instant appointment booking.

### **The "Face" (Frontend)**
*   **Dashboard**: `React (Vite)` + `TailwindCSS` - A premium, dark-mode administrative experience.
*   **Voice UI**: `Vanilla JS/CSS` - An interactive, glassmorphism-inspired AI Orb that visualizes real-time audio frequencies.

## ✨ Professional Standards

*   **Concurrency Safe**: Uses a localized context pattern where every call is a unique instance, preventing data leakage between patients.
*   **Proactive Engagement**: The agent greets users immediately upon connection—no awkward silence.
*   **Interruption Handling**: Advanced turn-detection allows the AI to stop speaking instantly if the user interrupts.
*   **RAG-Powered**: Answers are pulled from real clinic documentation, not just GPT's general knowledge.
